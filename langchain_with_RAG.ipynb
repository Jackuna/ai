It requires employees to be billed for at least 225 days annually. This reduces bench time to 35 days. The policy impacts compensation and career growth. Employees must upskill during unallocated periods. Work from office is now the default. Short-term project assignments are discouraged. The policy aims for better workforce utilization.AgenciesTCS bench policy Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has rolled out a new associate deployment policy that mandates a minimum of 225 billed business days annually for each employee, effectively limiting bench time to a maximum of 35 business days per year. The policy, effective June 12, aims to reduce idle time and ensure better workforce utilisation in line with the company’s organisational and individual performance goals.TCS New Bench Policy to Impact Compensation and Career Growth\"At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,\" a company document reviewed by TOI stated. \"Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,\" it added.The updated policy was outlined by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of TCS’s Resource Management Group (RMG), which handles talent deployment across the company. The RMG is responsible for ensuring that associates are continuously engaged in client projects.Responsibility lies with associates during unallocated periodsAccording to the document, associates not assigned to any project must take the initiative to find work. \"In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation.\"Unallocated resources are defined as those who are released to RMG, available for new assignments, and currently reporting to RMG.Live EventsUpskilling mandatory for those on benchWhile on the bench, associates are expected to dedicate 4 to 6 hours daily for learning through internal platforms such as iEvolve, Fresco Play, and VLS, along with external platforms like LinkedIn. They must complete all required training, attend recommended in-person sessions, and regularly update their skills. Associates are also expected to use TCS’s Gen AI interview coach, address interview feedback, and complete training programmes with full attendance.Work-from-office becomes the default modeTo enable faster project deployment, TCS has made physical office presence compulsory. Work-from-home or flexible work arrangements are not generally permitted. \"However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.\"Multiple short-term project assignments discouragedTCS has also cautioned against frequent short-term allocations across various projects. The policy notes that such patterns may trigger HR investigations and lead to disciplinary action.An email sent to TCS seeking comments on the new policy did not receive a response till the time of going to press.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)Read More News ontata consultancy servicesTCS new bench policyTCS bench policy\\u200bTCS bench period\\u200bTCS new bench period\\u200bTata Consultancy ServicesTCS HR policyTCS work from homeTCS work from office(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

task of creating a automation using service now ticket.This some how introduced me to Ansible API, Ansible Tower Webhooks and much more, during my exploration of Ansible tower and it's component I was somehow limited up to certain access, this insisted me to install Ansible AWX an Opensource version of Ansible Tower and I would again like to thank Redhat, for keeping an opensource version of it.The official release now doesn't support docker installation, instead they provide kubernetes installation guide, which for me personally is more hectic when it comes to testing and development.Here is the guide, I followed to install Ansible AWX on Ubuntu.External Link\\xa0Don't forget to Thanks the author !\\n\\nRead more ...\\n\\n\\n\\nShare !\\n\\n\\nTweet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPosted by\",

kind fun, think about a requirement and you can see a wide number opensource tools gives you wings to your idea, no hurdles just go with your goal, they all will support you..I would like to share you, what made me search internet and write this blog post.So within my Lab environment, it's a very frequent task to configure, update IP configuration of other virtual machines, so to tackle this task, I have already written an Ansible Role, which basically configures the IP address for the host which has existing dhcp address assigned to it.Now still there are some information I need to provide ansible before I proceed to run the playbook and the information it needs is, I need to manually look for free IPs in my current network.So I was curious how to scan my network for used and free IP addresses, thus I surfed the internet and found, my friendly network troubleshooting tool NMAP gives the insight about it.Let's see what command can be used to find those\", \"network for used

is expected as we have kept the bucket permission level as Block All Public Access.Okay, then let\\'s modify the bucket permission and Allow Public Access, for this follow the below two steps.Enable Public Access from Console by unchecking the Check box \"Block all public access\" and Save it.Append the below Bucket Policy JSON statement to make all objects inside the Bucket as Public, the one highlighted in red can be replaced by your own Bucket name.{\\n    \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\\n    \"Statement\": [\\n        {\\n            \"Sid\": \"AddPerm\",\\n            \"Effect\":

point, how accessing content via CloudFront URls is usefulCloudFront URLs give you better performance.CloudFront URL can provide Authentication mechanism.CloudFront URL gives additional possibilities to trigger CloudFront Function, which can be used for custom solutions.Sometimes content of a website/API is designed to be served via CloudFront only, accessing it from S3 gives you a portion of it's content.These are few counter points, but there are many more to support why should you disable public access to your s3 buckets.\", 'Read more ...\\n\\n\\n\\nShare

different S3 buckets as per above architecture diagram.As per the architecture diagram, create respective directories to match the URI path that ishttp://d233xxyxzzz.cloudfront.net/web1 -->

default settings.Note : Default root object to index.html, else we have to append index.html manually every time after /Now here comes the fun, we have our CloudFront URL in active state and thus according to our architecture this is what we are expecting overall.Create Origins for S3 buckets.Let\\'s add other two more origin, which are the two other remaining s3 buckets.Origin Configuration for S3 bucket \"s3-web1-bucket\"Origin Configuration for S3 bucket \"s3-web2-bucket\"Create Behaviors', 'add other two more origin, which are the two other remaining s3 buckets.Origin Configuration
